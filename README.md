# msm_speedup
This repository contains all code of the work: Exact and Heuristic Approaches to Speeding Up the MSM Time Series Distance Computation 

## Improved MSM Distance: MSM Distances 
## cMSM: MSM Distances 

## Heuristics
All heuristics are implemented for time series of unequal lengths (HeuristicsUnequalLengths) 
In some cases, there exists a faster implementation for time series of equal lengths (HeurisitcEqualLengths) 

## PrunedMSM
Same applies for the PrunedMSM Version. 
AdvancedLB = LB_t
SimpleLB = LB_ms
